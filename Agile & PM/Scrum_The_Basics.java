Scrum:
Allow team to deliver a milestones as small pieces.

Being a traditional PM is like to forecast the weather on a specific day on next year, except of luck u will be wrong, waterfall is not a bad thing, on some industries like construction, u have to follow a specific instructions.
but when apply it on empirical work like SW project, emprical work like a science experiment, u try something, check the result, and if didn't work, u try something else.

while there is a value in the items in the right, we vaue the items in the left more.

1. Work wz the Buz partner throughout the prj, 
Not to show at the begining to describe what they want, and at the end to tell us we have missed the mark.

2. Measure success using completed SW.

3. Allow team to be self-organized.


Scrum is about "Fail fast", 

Failure is ok, as long as you are learning from it.

- Small scale focus.
- Rapid learning cycles.

It's a daily opportunity to ask for help


Backlog refinement
- ongoing refinement.
- So yes, your backlog will change throughout the life of the project. 
- Sprint commitment can't be changed once the sprint begins. 
This helps the team keep their commitments, but also allows the Scrum team to adapt to the changing business needs throughout the life of the project.

Retrospective:
- Meeting focus on team performance at the end of sprint
