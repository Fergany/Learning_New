"1 hour technical zoom interview: half of the time we spent discussing how I solved the tasks in codility, other half we discussed my experience and challenges that I've solved so far"


- What is integration test?
- Which version of unit tests do you use?

How can you provide security while saving passwords in database
- roughly 55% of net users use the same password for multiple websites.
- 30% of websites that store your password in the database in plain text. 
- guidelines of storing your password to the database:
- Encryption functions do provide a one-one mapping between the input and the output â€“ and they're always reversible. If a breaker gets the key, he will be able to decrypt the password. The better and more sophisticated way would be to use a one-way cryptographic hash function. 

- How can you check Performance of a query?
- Discuss about one of the tool upon which I worked upon?

- Java 8 vs 1.6 (Java 8 new features).
- Why are you leaving your actual job?
- Why are you moving to Amsterdam?
- why do you want to work in adyen?
- they asked my previous experience?
- Any project you are proud of?  

- Why do you want to join Adyen, why do you want to relocate to amsterdam, how do you feel developing your own tools instead of using frameworks? Tell me about your last feedback? Tell me about one time that you mess up  

- questions based on your test, problem solving approach, java multithreading, query optimization etc. 

- Codility test , Java, Threading, Postgres  

- What is the motivation to come to work on Monday?  

- Basic work experience questions based on your CV.

- Very simple cryptography questions. For example, difference between symmetric key and asymmetric key.  

Pros

- A lot of freedom in what you want to work on
- Exchange programs with offices abroad
- Great people and atmosphere
- No corporate working hours. "Get your work done" attitude

Adyen's emphasis on maintaining its culture of global collaboration and an entrepreneurial spirit is borderline obsessive. This is a good thing, as the people here are genuinely nice people, talented and enthusiastic about the what the company is doing in the payment space.

- -tons of opportunity to travel (outside of COVID obviously!)
-amazing group of people who really enjoy working together
-have always felt like i can pick and choose how i spend my days as long as my projects have tangible business impact
-a lot of energy working across teams
-while we have a lot of new managers who need to gain experience, in general managers care about their teams and are there as a resource
-feels like somewhere i can grow a career (even without switching teams i see my role fundamentally evolve year over year)

Cons

- Freedom might be daunting for people who need to be told what to do
- Due to compliance and security it is difficult to get cutting edge tech into the codebase
