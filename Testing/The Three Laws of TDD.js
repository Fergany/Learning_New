Uncle Bob describes TDD with three rules:

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
 

"probably many of you have written unit test after the fact and if you have because it's the most common way of writing unit test, you discovered that it's not a lot of fun, and why isn't it fun, because you know the code works"
