Design patterns are general solutions to common object-oriented problems. You can use design patterns to create software that is more flexible, maintainable, and resilient to change. 

design patterns don't go directly into your code,
Instead, they first go into your brain. Once you've studied patterns and you have a good working knowledge of them, you can then start to apply them in your own object-oriented designs

Benefits
--------
- Not reinventing the wheel.
- Building resilient code.
- Preparing for future additions.

What are design patterns?
==========================
A design pattern is an approach to thinking about software design that incorporates the experience of developers who've had similar problems.

Creational Patterns
Structureal Patterns
Behavioral Patterns

What are design principles?
===========================
Design Principles --> General guidlines.
Design Patterns --> Specific solutions.


The Strategy Pattern
====================
inheritance
-----------
- is a relationship
- if all ur class relationships are IS-A relationships, take a closer look at ur design,
Why? Because as we're going to see, when you overuse inheritance, you can end up with designs that are inflexible and difficult to change.

Programming to Interface.


why HAS-A (composition) is better than IS-A (inheritance)?
use composition rather than inheritance because typically, composition leads to a more flexible design
