Our Goal
========
Design an API that is usefull for end users while respecting HTTP concepts and REST constrains.
You can't build something you can't design, 
and you can't design something you can't describe.

HTTP isn't perfect, but it's powerful, expressive, and we don't have a choice.

Why good API design is important?

The Key Aspect of API design:
- API design is hard, it's a game of tradeoff.
- Decide what functionality to expose.
- Decide how to expose it.
- Decide the best way to expose it.
- Test and (in)validate assumptions.
- Repeat.


-> What the API makes easy?
-> What the API does?
-> What the user wants to do?

When these three things don't fit, useless API.
